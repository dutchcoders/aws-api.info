You can also configure the new fleet\n// with the following settings: (1) a runtime configuration describing what\n// server processes to run on each instance in the fleet (required to create\n// fleet), (2) access permissions for inbound traffic, (3) fleet-wide game session\n// protection, and (4) the location of default log files for GameLift to upload\n// and store. \n// \n// If the CreateFleet call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following\n// tasks:\n// \n//  Creates a fleet record and sets the state to NEW (followed by other states\n// as the fleet is activated). Sets the fleet's capacity to 1 \"desired\", which\n// causes GameLift to start one new EC2 instance. Starts launching server processes\n// on the instance.
