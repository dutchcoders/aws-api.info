After the delivery\n// stream is created, its status is ACTIVE and it now accepts data. Attempts\n// to send data to a delivery stream that is not in the ACTIVE state cause an\n// exception. To check the state of a delivery stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream.\n// \n// The name of a delivery stream identifies it. You can't have two delivery\n// streams with the same name in the same region. Two delivery streams in different\n// AWS accounts or different regions in the same AWS account can have the same\n// name.\n// \n// By default, you can create up to 20 delivery streams per region.\n// \n// A delivery stream can only be configured with a single destination, Amazon\n// S3, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, or Amazon Redshift. For correct CreateDeliveryStream\n// request syntax, specify only one destination configuration parameter: either\n// S3DestinationConfiguration, ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration, or RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.\n// \n// As part of S3DestinationConfiguration, optional values BufferingHints, EncryptionConfiguration,\n// and CompressionFormat can be provided. By default, if no BufferingHints value\n// is provided, Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever\n// condition is satisfied first. Note that BufferingHints is a hint, so there\n// are some cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly;\n// for example, record boundaries are such that the size is a little over or\n// under the configured buffering size. By default, no encryption is performed.\n// We strongly recommend that you enable encryption to ensure secure data storage\n// in Amazon S3.\n// \n// A few notes about RedshiftDestinationConfiguration:\n// \n//   An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location,\n// as Firehose first delivers data to S3 and then uses COPY syntax to load data\n// into an Amazon Redshift table. This is specified in the RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration\n// parameter element.\n// \n//   The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified in RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration\n// because the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket\n// doesn't support these compression formats.\n// \n//   We strongly recommend that the username and password provided is used\n// exclusively for Firehose purposes, and that the permissions for the account\n// are restricted for Amazon Redshift INSERT permissions.\n// \n//   Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of destinations.\n// The IAM role should allow the Firehose principal to assume the role, and\n// the role should have permissions that allows the service to deliver the data.\n// For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Access (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3)\n// in the Amazon Kinesis Firehose Developer Guide.\n","HTTP":{"Method":"POST","RequestURI":"/","ResponseCode":0},"input":{"Documentation":"","shape":"CreateDeliveryStreamInput","Location":"","LocationName":"","QueryName":"","Flattened":false,"Streaming":false,"XMLAttribute":false,"XMLNamespace":{"Prefix":"","URI":""},"Payload":"","idempotencyToken":false,"deprecated":false},"output":{"Documentation":"","shape":"CreateDeliveryStreamOutput","Location":"","LocationName":"","QueryName":"","Flattened":false,"Streaming":false,"XMLAttribute":false,"XMLNamespace":{"Prefix":"","URI":""},"Payload":"","idempotencyToken":false,"deprecated":false},"Paginator":null,"deprecated":false,"authtype":""},"DeleteDeliveryStream":{"ExportedName":"DeleteDeliveryStream","Name":"DeleteDeliveryStream","Documentation":"// Deletes a delivery stream and its data.\n// \n// You can delete a delivery stream only if it is in ACTIVE or DELETING state,\n// and not in the CREATING state.
