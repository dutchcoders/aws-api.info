Security Token Service\u003c/fullname\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed information about using this service, go to \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\"\u003eTemporary Security Credentials\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cnote\u003e \u003cp\u003e As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to STS. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the \u003ca href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\"\u003eTools for Amazon Web Services page\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/note\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, go to \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html\"\u003eSigning AWS API Requests\u003c/a\u003e in the \u003ci\u003eAWS General Reference\u003c/i\u003e.
